# EtternaOnline API

This Rust crate provides an ergonomic wrapper around the v2 API of
[EtternaOnline](https://etternaonline.com), commonly abbreviated "EO".

The EO API requires a valid username and password combination to expose its functions. You will also need an API token called "client data".

Please don't use this crate for any malicious purposes.
